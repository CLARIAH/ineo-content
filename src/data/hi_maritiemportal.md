# Maritiem Portal
The Maritiem Portal is an entryway into as much information about Dutch maritime history as possible. The portal provides links to various collections from different organisations as well as the publication Nieuwe Maritieme Geschiedenis van Nederland (New Maritime History of the Netherlands).

## Overview
The *Maritiem Portal* is the entryway to information on exhibitions, publications, lectures, events, collections and organisations linked to the maritime history of the Netherlands. Besides news and information about new initiatives and events, the diverse maritime collections of various institutions are described and accessible via the portal. An important part of the portal is the publication *Nieuwe Maritieme Geschiedenis van Nederland* (New Maritime History of the Netherlands), which comprises four volumes and will be a new survey work recording the latest state of knowledge of Dutch maritime history in an international context. The (old) *Maritieme Geschiedenis der Nederlanden* (Maritime History of the Netherlands), which was published between 1976 and 1978, can also be accessed via the portal.

More than 1200 descriptions of maritime collections can be found in the *Maritiem Portal*. The overview is searchable via the keywords added to all individual collections. These are divided into four categories: general, georgraphy, institution and period.

### How to use this resource
The data cannot be downloaded on the *Maritiem Portal* itself. The *Maritiem Portal* does, however, provide links to different collections. The data can often be downloaded on the website of the organisation that created the dataset.

The *Maritiem Portal* is an initiative that was created by the 'Maritieme Koepel', an informal, national collaboration of Dutch maritime organisations.
