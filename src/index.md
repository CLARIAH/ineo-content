# Introduction 

This website shows curated texts on tools, data and standards of the CLARIAH project.

This site is not directly intended for end-users, the texts are meant to be
automatically incorporated in [Ineo](https://ineo.tools) instead.

See the [README](https://github.com/CLARIAH/ineo-content) for more information
and the editing procedure. An [administrative interface (CMS)](admin/) is
available to facilitate editing content.
