# Frog

Frog is an integration of memory-based natural language processing (NLP) modules developed for Dutch. It performs automatic linguistic enrichment such as part of speech tagging, lemmatisation, named entity recognition, shallow parsing, dependency parsing and morphological analysis.

## Overview

* Frog is an integration of memory-based natural language processing (NLP) modules developed for Dutch. 
* Frog performs tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization and morphological segmentation of word tokens. At the sentence level Frog identifies non-embedded phrase chunks in the sentence, recognizes named entities and assigns a dependency parse graph.
* Frog produces output in either FoLiA XML or a simple tab-delimited column format with one token per line.
* Where possible, Frog makes use of multi-processor support to run subtasks in parallel. Frog offers a command-line interface (that can also run as a daemon) and a C++ library.
