# Alpino

Alpino is a dependency parser for Dutch, developed in the context of the PIONIER Project Algorithms for Linguistic Processing. You can upload either tokenised or untokenised files. The output will consist of a zip file containing XML files, one for each sentence in the input document.

## Overview

* Alpino is a dependency parser for Dutch. It reliably analyses an input
  sentence syntactically, yielding a fully annotated syntactic tree with
  both constituents as well as explicitly labelled syntactic relations.
* Alpino is a rule-based parser with a statistics-based disambiguation
  component.
* Alpino can both be [installed
  locally](https://github.com/rug-compling/alpino) and be used
  [online](https://webservices.cls.ru.nl/alpino/). 
* In the online version, one can upload either tokenised or untokenised
  files. The output will consist of a zip file containing XML files, one for
  each sentence in the input document.
