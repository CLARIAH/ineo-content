# e-WLD: Electronisch woordenboek van de Limburgse dialecten

The [e-WLD](https://e-wld.nl/) is an online dictionary of the Limburgian dialects of Dutch. It stands for *Electronisch woordenboek van de Limburgse dialecten*.

## Overview

* The e-WLD contains the three volumes of the *Woordenboek van de Limburgse dialecten*, that was published between 1983 and 2008.

* Users can query the e-WLD for keywords and concepts, as well as locations (using a placename or a [Kloekecode](https://kloeke.meertens.knaw.nl/)) and dialects.

* The e-WLD contains 17,539 concepts, 137,231 keywords, and 1,759,090 dialectal entries, collected in over 1000 Limburgian places, with each place corresponding to its own dialect.

* Volume II.5 of the WLD was devoted to the 19 mines of Limburg (12 in the Netherlands, 7 in Belgium). The mines were home to a special subdialects of Limburgian, and these mines therefore form an extension to the Limburg town network. It is possible to search for these mines specifically in the e-WLD.

* Together with the [e-WALD](https://www.ineo.tools/resources/ewald), [e-WBD](https://www.ineo.tools/resources/ewbd) and the [e-WGD](https://www.ineo.tools/resources/ewgd), the e-WLD forms a series of electronic dictionaries.

#### Editing and digitization
In 2015, the first two volumes of the *Woordenboek van de Limburgse dialecten* were digitized thanks to a grant awarded by CLARIN for the project 'CARE: Curation and integration of regional dictionaries' led by Nicoline van der Sijs, Henk van den Heuvel and Roeland van Hout (RU).

Eric Sanders (RU) designed a macro and script for semi-automatic digitization. Research assistant Aukje Borkent, data curator Linda van Meel (thanks to a subsidy grom the Raod veur 't Limburgs), student assistants Jorik van Engeland, Inge Otto, Lisette van der Heijde and Hanna van den Heuvel, and interns Maaike Borst and Eline Dimmendaal had all texts read by the macro and the result was accurately corrected manually. Volunteers Jantien Kettenes-Van den Bosch and Herman Wiltink have carried out a pre-correction for many parts.

Joep Kruijsen, one of the original editors, offered his enormous know-how for the digitization and carried out a lot of correction work; for example, he corrected all phonetic signs from volume II. Corrections of the first volume are not yet available on the e-WLD.
