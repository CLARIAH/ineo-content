# BurgerLinker

BurgerLinker is a command line tool for linking civil registries. It is designed for researchers to link multiple civil records (e.g. birth, marriage and death certificates) to describe a life course. However, burgerLinker is also capable of linking other personal records.
## Overview

* BurgerLinker is a command line tool which allows researchers to link civil records, relying on the mentioned names of ego, father, mother, and partner on the civil record, modeled according to our Civil Registries schema.
* Because the Dutch civil registry contains millions of records, BurgerLinker is designed to be scalable and link the records fast
* BurgerLinker uses a RDF dataset as input and converts them into HDT for efficient computing.
* BurgerLinker produces a CSV file or a N-QUADS file as output.
