Introduction This repository stores the rich content for the Ineo Resource finder. We denote the various curated texts pertaining to resources as 'rich content'. A select team of CLARIAH's communication department is working on these texts. This repository enables easy collaboration, also with developers and data providers, and provides a sustainable storage solution. Rich content can be contrasted to the automatically harvested metadata that results from the CLARIAH Tool Discovery track or the FAIR Datasets track and is not supposed to overlap. For automatically harvested metadata, the primary authorship lies with the tool/data producer. For rich user content, it lies with the people of the communication department (WP1). The rich content in this repository is stored in Markdown format , a simple plain text format for text markup. We follow a specific structure to the data can be easily ingested into Ineo, as well as any other systems who want to make use of it. The content can be previewed directly on https://clariah.github.io/ineo-content . We used a simple static site generator ( MkDocs ) to achieve this. That site, however, is not intended for end-users to be used directly. On the preview site we also provide access to a simple headless CMS to facilitate working with the Markdown files in the git repository, without requiring real technical knowledge of either. Directory Structure Directories: src/ - Contains Markdown texts tools/ - Contains Markdown texts describing tools. data/ - Contains Markdown texts describing data workflows/ - Contains Markdown texts describing workflows standards/ - Contains Markdown texts describing standards media/ - Stores images or other associated media files, Right now all media files are in this single folder, without subfolders, this limitation is only due to the admin CMS. You can reference images from the markdown files, just use /media/ as URL prefix when doing so. Images or downloadable documents/spreadsheets/presentations that are referenced from one of the markdown files may be included in this subdirectory. Videos are not suitable for direct inclusion in the git repository as they are too big, they need to be hosted elsewhere. Ensure the media files you upload here are suitable for use on the web, pay attention to file-size, format and resolution. Within these directories, each resource is described by a single Markdown file, with optional YAML frontmatter . The title of the markdown file (a level-one heading, e.g. # ) corresponds with the title of the resource as shown in the frontend. The extension is always .md . The paragraph(s) immediately succeeding the level-one heading are taken to be the description, for tools (unless it concerns a tool suite), this generally be omitted as the description should be automatically drawn from the metadata. The markdown file contains sections marked with level two headings ( ## ), each should correspond to agreed-upon tabs shown in the Ineo frontend, we currently distinguish the following: Overview Learn Mentions The content editors and frontend developers can introduce new ones when needed. Any subsections (level-three headings and beyond) can be used freely. YAML frontmatter The markdown files can be enriched with YAML frontmatter to convey some extra information. This is NOT intended for extensive tool/data metadata, as those come directly from different data provisioning pipelines and are not kept in this repository. The only metadata we always duplicate is the title of the resource, which typically also determines the filename (in a 'slug' form in lowercase only and with spaces replaced by hyphens). --- title: The title of the resource --- For tools , we use either the identifier or group field to link to https://tools.clariah.nl . The identifier links to an exact resource, such as frog for https://tools.clariah.nl/frog , i.e. it is identical to what appears in the URL. The other one, group , links to a group or tool suite because the level of granularity offered on https://tools.clariah.nl may be too fine-grained compared to what is desirable for Ineo or other portals. It should be exact name of the group as it appears on the tool discovery overview. The name s of the groups an be easily spotted by looking at the table of contents there; the groups are the ones with sub-items. --- identifier: tool title: Tool --- If both identifier and group are set, the identifier is used to associate metadata of one specific tool in the group/suite with the group as a whole. This allows you to still describe a whole tool suite in Ineo, but picks one of the tools in the suite as being its representative and have its metadata prominently features. The following Ineo-specific metadata can be added: (TODO: add specification of part of Ineo's YAML syntax that are reusable. This is something for the Ineo developers to specify.) Ineo currently allows for a carousel widget showing several images in sequence (see for example https://www.ineo.tools/resources/media-suite ). The data definition for such a widget would go in the YAML frontmatter, I would propose something like: --- carousel: - /media/mediasuite-cover1.png - https://vimeo.com/503507411?embedded=true&source=vimeo_logo&owner=115309374 - /media/mediasuite-cover2.png - /media/mediasuite-cover3.png - /media/mediasuite-cover4.png --- Note these are specifically for Ineo and won't be previewed in the editor. For data and standards, no way of linking to underlying registries via identifiers has been defined yet. (take this up with Menzo) Editing Content Management System (CMS) A headless CMS ( DecapCMS previously known as NetlifyCMS) is available to make it easier for content editors to do their editing. Within the CMS, both the Markdown content and the YAML frontmatter can be edited in a WYSIWYG fashion without knowledge of either Markdown or YAML. A GitHub account is required to edit. The CMS can be accessed here The CMS is a nice convenience but it also enforced some limitations, it has put the following constraints on this specification: All media files are stored in a single directory /media/ and does not allow further divisions in subdirectories. Online IDE An alternative to using the CMS is to use GitHub's online Visual Studio Code IDE. Each page on https://clariah.github.io/ineo-content has an edit this page link that automatically takes you to the web-based IDE. This offers a bit more freedom than the CMS. Local editing Being a simple git repository with MarkDown files, you are not constrained to either of the above options but can simply clone this git repository locally and work with your text editor of choice, such as vim, emacs, VSCode, Sublime, or something specifically geared for comfortable Markdown editing such as Zettlr . Version Control As a version control system, git will ensure all versions of the content are tracked throughout their history. You can use git tools to revert to previous versions if needed. It also offers an exact provenance trail of who edited what and when, offering maximum transparency. Contributions and Maintainers Anybody can contribute directly to the content by simply doing pull requests. The maintainers of this repository review and accept or decline those pull requests. This procedure enables the maintainers to easily collaborate with tool and data developers.

Overview grlc is a lightweight server that takes SPARQL queries (stored in a GitHub repository, in your local filesystem, or listed in a URL), and translates them to Linked Data Web APIs. This enables universal access to Linked Data. Users are not required to know SPARQL to query their data, but instead can access a web API. grlc assumes that you have a collection of SPARQL queries as .rq files. grlc will create one API operation for each SPARQL query/.rq file in the collection. Your queries can add API parameters to each operation by using the parameter mapping syntax. This allows your query to define query variables which will be mapped to API parameters for your API operation (see here for an example).

It facilitates scholarly research with large Dutch media collections by providing advanced search and analysis tools. Overview The CLARIAH Media Suite is an application for doing research with data collections by scholars and students at universities and in higher education (e.g., film, television, and other media scholars, oral historians, and political historians). It consists of three building blocks: data, tools to work with the data, and a workspace to store your work with the data. The Media Suite is an innovative digital research environment, an experimental environment (LAB) , in which we are experimenting with new ways of working with multimedia data collections. It caters to various levels of expertise and research interests: from providing access to many audio-visual collections for exploratory research to close reading; and from more complex modes of data analysis to distant reading strategies. The transparent search and analysis tools that the Media Suite offers, combined with its APIs that can be used with Jupyter notebooks, allow for many new possibilities for research and represents the middle ground between full algorithmic literacy and being a data novice. Users from Dutch universities and research institutes can log into the Media Suite using their university credentials. Read more about access to the Media Suite . Data Via the CLARIAH infrastructure, the Media Suite provides access to data collections in Dutch archives (among others: The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, EYE Film Museum collections, DANS oral history interview collections, collections from the Open Images Project). Typically, data collections are registered in a registry that allows the infastructure to either access collections directly or use some form of data harvesting to enables access.
